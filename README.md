## ðŸ“¢ UPDATED FOR NEXT.JS 13.5 ðŸ“¢

- We have updated this starter for Next.js 13. It is using a pre-release version of the [@agility/nextjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@agility/nextjs) npm package specialized for app router.

- Support for Next.js 13 and React 18
- Connected to a sample Agility CMS Instance for sample content & pages
- Uses the `getStaticProps` function from Next.js to allow for full SSG (Static Site Generation)

- Supports the `next/font` package
- Uses the `revalidate` and `fallback` properties to enable [ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#incremental-static-regeneration) builds

## Running the Site Locally

### Development Mode

When running your site in `development` mode, you will see the latest content in real-time from the CMS.

#### yarn

1. `yarn install`
2. `yarn dev`

This will launch the site in development mode, using your preview API key to pull in the latest content from Agility.

#### npm

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`

### Production Mode

When running your site in `production` mode, you will see the published content from Agility.

#### yarn

1. `yarn build`
2. `yarn start`

#### npm

1. `npm run build`
2. `npm run start`

## Accessing Content

You can use the Agility Content Fetch SDK normally - either REST or GraphQL within server components.

## Deploying Your Site

The easiest way to deploy a Next.js website to production is to use [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) from the creators of Next.js, or [Netlify](https:netlify.com). Vercel and Netlify are all-in-one platforms - perfect for Next.js.
